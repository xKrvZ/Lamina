//! The UI pass composites *over* whatever is already in the colour target.
//!
//! The host app draws its 3D (or other) pass first, then runs the GUI pass on
//! the same surface view before presenting. That works only because the GUI pass loads the
//! existing attachment instead of clearing it. Nothing in the type system
//! enforces this: flipping the pass's `LoadOp::Load` to `LoadOp::Clear` would
//! blank the viewport with no compile error.
//!
//! # Why these tests draw something
//!
//! `GuiRenderer::render` returns early when a frame produces no vertices, so
//! the render pass is never begun and `LoadOp` is never reached. A frame that
//! draws nothing therefore cannot detect a clear — it leaves the target intact
//! for the unrelated reason that no pass ran. Every test that means to exercise
//! the load behaviour must emit geometry and then sample a region that geometry
//! does not cover.
//!
//! All tests skip when no graphics adapter is available.
